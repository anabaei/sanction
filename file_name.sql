10-percent kickback on goods purchased through the UN Oil-for-Food (OFF) Program and to procure goods unauthorized by the United Nations. A letter signed by former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Hikmat Mizban Ibrahim al-Azzawi, dated 2 January 2001, provided instructions for the Iraqi government to obtain a 10-percent fee payment on all goods purchased from other countries under OFF. The letter instructed Iraqi government officials to purchase the goods through trading companies, one of which was AWB. A separate document from al-Azzawi set out the procedure for collecting the 10-percent fee from companies engaging in trade with Iraq. The document specifies that the Rafidain Bank in Jordan can be used for receiving the funds in these transfers and that AWB is to be used to transfer the goods. Information in the possession of the United States indicates that AWB was involved in an attempt by Iraq to purchase a sophisticated surface-to-air missile system. Approximately $43.5 million was in a United Arab Emirates (UAE) bank that was to be used as partial payment for this system under the terms and conditions of the missile contract. This purchase involving military goods was prohibited under United Nations sanctions against Iraq. An investigation of the missile deal by the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\'s office (BICE), in Tampa Florida, revealed that: - A business account for AWB was opened at the Abu Dhabi National Bank (NBAD) in 24 December 2000 by a UAE national and Hikmat Jarjes Bahnam, an Iraqi national whose passport identifies him as an Iraqi government official. Both were named as licensed for trading for AWB. Tarik Nasser S. Al Obaidi, an Iraqi national, was also a signatory of this account. - One early transaction of the NBAD business account was an inbound transfer of $7 million by order of Hekmat Mazban Ibrahim, who is probably Hikmat Mizban Ibrahim al-Azzawi, in December 2000. Shortly thereafter, $6.9 million of that amount was transferred by order of al-Azzawi to a second AWB account. - From early 2001 to early 2002 there were numerous additional transfers between two AWB accounts resulting in a balance of $43.5 million in one of them. - Documents obtained during the investigation show that the $43.5 million balance was directly related to \"contract N24398,\" the purpose of which was to fulfill the sale of the radarcontrolled surface-to-air missile system to Iraq. An official of the Abu Dhabi National Bank told U.S. BICE investigators that it was unusual that the AWB accounts that contained the $43.5 million only had Iraqi personnel as signatories for accessing the monies. The bank official told the investigators that the principal of the company, a UAE citizen, had no control over the monies deposited, and that the Iraqi government and its agents are the real owners of AWB. Tarik al-\'Ubaydi, an Iraqi national who previously served as director of the Iraqi Central Bank and as of 2001 was part of AWB\'s office staff, and Iraqi national Joseph Girguis who was also formerly employed by the Iraqi Central Bank, acted as Uday Saddam Hussein\'s representatives in Dubai.','1518 (Iraq)','http://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/security/sanctions/Pages/sanctions.aspx','AL WASEL AND BABEL GENERAL TRADING LLC','2018-12-31 03:12:17','2018-12-31 03:12:17'),('au-dfat-sanctions.1014','au-dfat-sanctions','entity','Iraq-based Al-Huda State Company for Religious Tourism (Al-Huda) served as a commercial front for the Iraqi Intelligence Service, an agency of the former Iraqi government, and was controlled by Uday Saddam Hussein, the son of the former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

The group was formed in 2000, and, as detailed below, has committed serious violations of international law involving the targeting of women and children in armed conflict in the DRC, including killing and maiming, sexual violence, and forced displacement. According to a 2010 report from Amnesty International on Human Rights in the DRC, the FDLR were responsible for the killings of ninety-six civilians in Busurguni, Walikali territory. Some of the victims were burned alive in their homes. According to a 2010 report from Amnesty International on Human Rights in the DRC, in June 2010, an NGO medical centre reported around sixty cases a month of girls and women who had been raped in the southern Lubero territory, North-Kivu armed groups including the FDLR. According to a December 20, 2010 report from Human Rights Watch (HRW), there has been documented evidence of the FDLR actively conducting child recruitment. HRW has identified at least 83 Congolese children under the age of 18, some as young as 14, who have been forcibly recruited by the FDLR. In January of 2012, HRW reported that FLDR combatants attacked numerous villages in the Masisi territory, killing six civilians, raping two women, and abducting at least 48 people whose whereabouts remain unknown. According to a June 2012 report from HRW, in May 2012 FDLR fighters attacked civilians in Kamananga and Lumenje, in South Kivu province, as well as in Chambucha, Walikale territory, and villages in the Ufumandu area of Masisi territory, North Kivu province. In these attacks, FDLR fighters with machetes and knives hacked to death dozens of civilians, including numerous children. According to the June 2012 Group of Experts Report, the FDLR attacked several villages in South Kivu from December 31, 2011 to January 4, 2012. A United Nations investigation confirmed that at least 33 persons, including 9 children and 6 women, had been killed, either burned alive, decapitated or shot during the attack. In addition, one woman and one girl had been raped. The June 2012 Group of Experts Report also states that a United Nations investigation confirmed that the FDLR massacred at least 14 civilians, including 5 women and 5 children in South Kivu in May 2012. According to the November 2012 Group of Experts report, the UN documented at least 106 incidents of sexual violence committed by the FDLR between December 2011 and September 2012. The November 2012 Group of Experts report notes that, according to a UN investigation, the FDLR raped seven women in the night of 10 March 2012, including a minor, in Kalinganya, Kabare territory. The FDLR attacked the village again on 10 April 2012 and raped three of the women for the second time. The November 2012 Group of Experts report also reports 11 killings by the FDLR in Bushibwambombo, Kalehe on 6 April 2012, and FDLR involvement in 19 further killings in Masisi territory, including five minors and six women, in May.

Several eyewitness testimonies state that M23 receives general military supplies from the Rwandan Defense Forces (RDF) in the form of weapons and ammunition in addition to materiel support for combat operations. M23 has been complicit in and responsible for committing serious violations of international law involving the targeting of women and children in situations of armed conflict in the DRC including killing and maiming, sexual violence, abduction, and forced displacement. According to numerous reports, investigations, and testimonies from eyewitnesses, M23 has been responsible for carrying out mass killings of civilians, as well as raping women and children throughout various regions of the DRC. Several reports indicate that M23 fighters have carried out 46 rapes against women and girls, the youngest of which was 8 years old. In addition to reports of sexual violence, M23 has also carried out extensive forced recruitment campaigns of children into the ranks of the group. It is estimated that M23 has carried out the forced recruitment of 146 young men and boys in the Rutshuru territory alone in eastern DRC since July 2012. Some of the victims have been as young as 15 years old. The atrocities committed by M23 against the civilian population of the DRC, as well as M23\'s forced recruitment campaign, and being the recipient of arms and military assistance has dramatically contributed to instability and conflict within the region and in some instances, violated international law.
